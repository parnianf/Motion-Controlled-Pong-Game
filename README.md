# Motion-Controlled-Pong-Game

This project aims to make a game similar to Pong, whose environment consists of a ball and a paddle. This game is designed as a single user and is controlled by using accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on a smartphone with the Android operating system.


To start and play the game, the device is placed on a flat surface like a table. The game environment on the table is 50 cm long; The device will be allowed to move 25 cm to the right and 25 cm to the left on the table. In whatever direction we move the device, the paddle will also move in the same direction. Also, if we rotate the device around its perpendicular axis, the paddle will also rotate in the same way.


In this project, the **Canvas** library is used to draw two-dimensional components on the screen, and physical formulas are used to simulate the motion of the ball and paddle.
